👨‍💻 About Me

I’m focused on learning and building backend systems, with a strong interest in high-performance, asynchronous architectures and how they integrate with Generative AI in real-world applications.

🔭 Currently learning by building FastAPI microservices, exploring RAG-style pipelines and AI-backed APIs.

🏗️ Actively developing skills in system design, vector-based retrieval, and LLM orchestration concepts.

🧠 Exploring agentic workflows and practical ways to integrate large language models into backend services.

⚡ Performance-curious: experimenting with latency, token usage, and concurrency trade-offs.
